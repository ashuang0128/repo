            <h1>Choosing the best skateboard</h1>
            <p>If you’ve ever searched the web for best skateboard brands, best skateboard 2021, or best anything from anytime ever, you’ve no doubt encountered a bunch of review sites with write ups that don’t actually provide useful or accurate information. The truth is, most of these websites are run by people who are looking to make money from Amazon referral links. Often, the reviews are auto-generated by software, and not even written by a real person.
                <br>
                We think product research should be informative and enjoyable. There’s nothing quite as exciting as deciding which new skateboard you’re going to get, except riding that new board of course.</p>

                <li><a href="">Cruisers</a><span> – Smaller boards, ideal for skating around town and exploring the city. They’ve got kicktails, soft wheels and are fast becoming our most popular boards.</span></li>
                <li><a href="">ATVs</a> – All-Terrain-Vehicle. These are boards that are designed to skate the city, hit spots, do tricks and get allow you to put your own style into your skating. Soft wheels make them quiet and comfortable when pushing. A great skateboard for beginners.</li>
                <li><a href="">Longboards</a>– Larger boards that are great for cruising on pathways. They are less maneuverable than our smaller boards, but are way more “surfy”. We also have a bunch of Drop Mounted skateboards in this category. Those are great for higher speed riding and carving mellow hills.</li>
                <li><a href="">Downhill Freeride</a> – Our fastest boards can be found here. These boards are packed with a ton of technology and features, all of which are geared towards fast, downhill skateboarding. You’ll find both Drop Mounted and Hollowtech skateboards in this category.</li>
                <li><a href="">Dance and Freestyle</a> – We’ve developed this line of boards to meet the growing demands of Dance and Freestyle skaters. We’ve got some Hollowtech longboards in this category as well so make sure to check out these too.</li>
